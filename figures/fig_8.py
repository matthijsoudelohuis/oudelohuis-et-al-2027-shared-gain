Figure 8 -- Principles generalize to naturalistic visual processing

Planned panels
--------------
a. Multiplicative and additive modulation by population rate observed for natural images (model-free)
b. Tuning-dependent noise correlations replicated, predicted by TF-slope x coupling product
c. Population geometry (cone) observed for natural images as well
d. KNN decoding of image identity improves with population rate and most for intermediate coupling

This script only builds the print-ready figure canvas and panel scaffold (see
figures/fig_utils.py and CLAUDE.md, "Publication figure pipeline"). No analysis or plotting
of real results happens here -- panel content should be filled in from the corresponding
run_xxx / ana_xxx outputs once those analyses are ready.
