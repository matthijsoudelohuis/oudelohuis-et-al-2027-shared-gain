Supplementary Figure S6 -- supports Figure 6 (Generalization of the mechanistic framework across species)

No supplementary panels were specified for this figure in the paper outline yet -- fill in once decided.

Planned panels
--------------
(none specified yet -- TODO)

This script only builds the print-ready figure canvas and panel scaffold (see
figures/fig_utils.py and CLAUDE.md, "Publication figure pipeline"). No analysis or plotting
of real results happens here -- panel content should be filled in from the corresponding
run_xxx / ana_xxx outputs once those analyses are ready.
